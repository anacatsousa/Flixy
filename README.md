# Flixy

Flixy is a fictional movie and TV show streaming platform, built with a focus on delivering a smooth, modern, and responsive user experience.

The application was developed using React and SCSS, with React Router for client-side navigation and React Select for dynamic and customizable filtering. The project simulates a streaming interface where users can browse content, explore categories, and discover new titles in an intuitive way.
